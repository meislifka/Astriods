# Astriods
This is a clone of space invaders using pygame. 
This project was my first introduction into pygame I made in summer to winter of 2019. The goal of this project was to integrate it into an escaperoom I made. I followed the tutorial guide from a youtube video by Tech with Tim and can be found here: https://youtu.be/Q-__8Xw9KTM.  I edited the images of the spaceships as well as changed some features such as the speed, lives, number of levels, and the end game screen.
